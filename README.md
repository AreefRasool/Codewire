# ⚡ CodeWire Pro — Engineering Compliance Hub

**CodeWire Pro** is an all-in-one electrical engineering dashboard that turns manual cable-sizing and compliance calculations into an instant, visual, and shareable web app. Built with **Gradio** and **Plotly**, it brings together voltage drop analysis, wire sizing, conduit design, box fill, ampacity lookups, material estimation, and one-click executive PDF reports — all wrapped in a sleek, dark, glassmorphism-inspired interface with a live-updating KPI dashboard.

Whether you're a student validating textbook formulas or an engineer sanity-checking a quick design, CodeWire Pro gives you instant, visual feedback instead of spreadsheets and manual lookups.

- **📦 Conduit Design** — Calculates conduit fill percentage and recommends conduit size with a bar chart.
- **📐 Box Fill Calculator** — Computes required box volume from conductors, devices, and grounds.
- **🔥 Ampacity Lookup** — Quick reference ampacity ratings for standard wire sizes.
- **📋 Material Estimator** — Estimates wire and conduit material requirements with a donut chart breakdown.
- **📊 Executive Analytics** — Compliance meter and auto-generated executive summary, side-by-side.
- **📂 Project Manager** — Save and reload multiple project calculations by name.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) | Web UI framework |
| [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) | Interactive charts (gauges, bar, pie) |
| [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/) | PDF report generation |
| Python 3.9+ | Core logic |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
python codewire_pro.py
```

The app will launch locally and also generate a temporary public link (via Gradio's `share=True`).

> 💡 **Running in Google Colab / Kaggle?** Just upload `codewire_pro.py`, install dependencies with `!pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run the script — Gradio will give you a shareable public link.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses a simple engineering health-score model:

```
Health Score = 100 − (Voltage Drop % × 8)
```

- **Score ≥ 90** → ✅ PASS
- **Score 70–89** → ⚠️ WARNING
- **Score < 70** → ❌ FAIL

Wire sizing follows standard AWG current-capacity tiers, and all calculations update the live dashboard KPI cards in real time.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for multi-user project storage
- Export project history to Excel/CSV
- Add support for 3-phase voltage drop calculations
- Persist projects to a database instead of in-memory storage
